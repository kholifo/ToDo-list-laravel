# ToDo List

Hi! Here is a simple **ToDo list** built in laravel with multiple users . 

## Demo

**Working on it!**

## Installation

 - Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/kholifo/ToDo-list-laravel.git
```
- Move into the folder with this command
```
cd ToDo list
```
- Do a composer install

```
composer install
```
- Create a environment file using this command

```
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit these two parameter(`DB_USERNAME`,  `DB_PASSWORD`) there, on your database's user name and password.

- Then **create** a database named  `tasks`  and do a database migration using this command

```
php artisan migrate
```
- Finally, run server 

```
php artisan serve
```
**Have fun!**
